# first_landing_page
This is my first projecti in building a landing page from scratch using HTML & CSS.

This is a landing page project from The Odin Project curriculum that helped me learn various concepts related to page layout, including flexbox. 

The page is divided into four sections.

The header section contains a logo and a list of links, while the first section has a centered title, subtext, and a button. 

The second section is composed of multiple illustrations, each with their own subtext. 

The third section has a centered inspiring quote and a quote signature. Lastly, the fourth section is composed of a square container with a call-to-action button.
